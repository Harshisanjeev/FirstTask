Fache glanced over. “I gather, Mr. Langdon, you have never seen the Louvre after hours?”
I guess not, Langdon thought, trying to get his bearings.
Usually impeccably illuminated, the Louvre galleries were startlingly dark tonight. Instead of the
customary flat-white light flowing down from above, a muted red glow seemed to emanate upward
from the baseboards-intermittent patches of infrared spilling out onto the tile floors.
As Langdon gazed down the murky corridor, he realized he should have anticipated this scene.
Virtually all major galleries employed infrared service-lighting at night—strategically placed, low-level,
non-invasive lights that enabled staff members to navigate hallways and yet kept the paintings in
relative darkness to slow the fading effects of overexposure to light. Tonight, the museum possessed
an almost oppressive quality. Long shadows encroached everywhere, and the usually soaring vaulted
ceilings appeared as a low, black void.
“This way,” Fache said, turning sharply right and setting out through a series of interconnected galleries.
Langdon followed, his vision slowly adjusting to the dark. All around, large-format oils began to
materialize like photos developing before him in an enormous darkroom...their eyes following as
he moved through the rooms. He could taste the familiar tang of museum air—an arid, deionized
essence that carried a faint hint of carbon-the product of industrial, coal-filter dehumidifiers that ran
around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbon-dioxide exhaled by visitors.
