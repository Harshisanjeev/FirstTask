Langdon sensed Fache did not see at all. Jacques Saunière was considered the premiere goddess
iconographer on earth. Not only did Saunière have a personal passion for relics relating to fertility,
goddess cults, Wicca, and the sacred feminine, but during his twenty year tenure as curator, Saunière
had helped the Louvre amass the largest collection of Goddess art on earth-labrys axes from the
priestesses’ oldest Greek shrine in Delphi, gold caducei wands, hundreds of Tjet ankhs resembling
small standing angels, Sistrum rattles used in ancient Egypt to dispel evil spirits, and an astonishing
array of statues depicting Horus being nursed by the goddess Isis.
“Perhaps Jacques Saunière knew of your manuscript?” Fache offered. “And he called the meeting to
offer his help on your book.”
Langdon shook his head. “Actually, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. It’s still in draft form,
and I haven’t shown it to anyone except my editor.”
Fache fell silent.
Langdon did not add the reason he hadn’t yet shown the manuscript to anyone else.
