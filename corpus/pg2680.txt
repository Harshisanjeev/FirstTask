Langdon had hung enough NE PAS DERANGER signs on hotel room doors to catch the gist of the
captain’s orders. Fache and Langdon were not to be disturbed under any circumstances.
Leaving the small congregation of agents behind, Fache led Langdon farther down the darkened
hallway. Thirty yards ahead loomed the gateway to the Louvre’s most famous section-Le Grande
Galerie-a seemingly endless corridor that housed the Louvre’s most valuable Italian masterpieces.
Langdon had already discerned that this was where Saunière’s body lay; the Grand Gallery’s famous
parquet floor had been unmistakable in the Polaroid.
As they approached, Langdon saw the entrance was blocked by an enormous steel grate that looked
like something used by medieval castles to keep out marauding armies.
“Containment security,” Fache said, as they neared the grate.
Even in the darkness, the barricade looked like it could have restrained a tank.
Arriving outside, Langdon peered through the bars into the dimly lit caverns of the Grand Gallery.
